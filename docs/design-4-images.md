Imagery is a core aspect of WFP’s online presence. To maximise the impact on our visitors we need both: a powerful photographs and great visual presentation.

- You can present your images using virtually any image size, as long as the aspect ratio stays the same defined by the Image Size Breakdown table.
- Keep in mind what a given image will be intended for; use our Image Size Breakdown table to help you choose the right image size for the right purpose.
- Try not to include more than two images per article; this will help ensure your page loads as fast as possible.
- Make sure your image is of an appropriate size for its intended purpose; don’t use a 600x400px image where a 300x200px image is needed, or small images to display large splash sections.
