To create a great User Interface you have to keep a few things in mind. Those things are: *hierarchy*, *alignment* and *simplicity*. It's easy to do if you adhere to the following guidelines:

###### Content Comes First
Before you start composing the layout of your page, please make sure you have your content ready. Keep everything simple and neutral, to let the content stand out on its own.

###### Provide Context
When creating a landing page, you need context that would back up the content and make it more prominent. This will help focus user's attention on that particular section, whether it's a title or an image, or maybe something else you have in mind.

###### Frame The Page
Use our header pattern to frame your page. It doesn't have to be exactly the same, as it refers to your own content structure, but it will indicate that your content belongs to the same network/brand, by using our primary branding colours.

###### Left-align Content
Most of the content should be aligned to the left, unless it's intended for Arabic languages or a fly-out. This will help with making dense content structures less intimidating and easier to read.

###### Spacing Is Good
Give your content a bit of space; padding and margins around most elements helps your pages breathe, whether it's an article page or a contact form, elements need space to stay effective.

###### Provide Focus
Show the visitor exactly what your intentions are. Provide only one primary call to action and make it front and center. If additional actions are needed, make sure they have less importance and are not too close to each other.
