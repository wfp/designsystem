The select component collects user-provided information from a list of options. Selects are usually used in forms where a user submits data and chooses one option from a list.

## Usage

Use a dropdown list when there are multiple choices that can be collapsed under one title, if the list of items is too long, or when space is constrained.
Use a dropdown list when the selected option is more important than the alternatives (in contrast to radio buttons where all the choices are visible, putting equal emphasis on all options).

<DoUse>

- The dropdown list label should describe what can be found in the menu.
- Use shortened statements or single words as list options.
- If there isn't a default option, use `Select an option` as placeholder text.
- If `None` is an option, include it.
- Write the choices using parallel construction. For example, start with the
  same part of speech or verb tense.

</DoUse>

<DoNotUse>

- Avoid using `Select` for less then 3 entries. Try using a radio button instead.
