      In mid-2016, widespread inter-ethnic tensions and conflict descended on
      the Kasai region of the <a href="#">Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)</a>
      , claiming countless lives and causing massive displacement. The Kasai
      crisis unfolded within a country already struggling with a protracted and
      underfunded emergency in the east. Since the emergence of the Kasai
      crisis, funding shortfalls proved to be a major challenge to WFP’s
      response.
