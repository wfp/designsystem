# Create Design System [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-green.svg)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Create Design System is a tool to initialize a design-system boilerplate with no build configuration.

## Quick Overview

```sh
npx @wfp/create-design-system my-design-system
cd my-design-system
yarn start:react
```

### Alpha releases

```sh
npx @wfp/create-design-system@alpha my-design-system
```

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.<br>
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.

## Creating an App

**You’ll need to have Node 14.0.0 or later version on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects.

You also need [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) since we are using yarn workspaces in the default configuration.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx

```sh
npx @wfp/create-design-system my-design-system
```

### Yarn

```sh
yarn create @wfp/design-system my-design-system
```

_[`yarn create <starter-kit-package>`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) is available in Yarn 0.25+_

It will create a directory called `my-design-system` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:
