### Provide Autosave

Especially longer forms should provide autosave by default. You should
also provide a very clear feedback by displaying a message that shows
when the last autosave happened or a Save-Button. The user should be
always able to also save forms with an error.

### Top-left aligned labels are best for readability & completion

Placing labels above input fields is preferable since research show
these are better trackable for users than left-aligned labels [read more](http://uxmovement.com/forms/why-infield-top-aligned-form-labels-are-quickest-to-scan/)

<Blockquote title="Example">
  <TextInput {...TextInputProps} />
</Blockquote>

### Avoid placing inputs side-by-side.

User attention should always be directed on one task at a time, 2 items
on the same line will compete for attention as there is no visual
priority between them, resulting in a heavier task for the user.

The only exception to this rule is when the input needs multiple field
elements like asking for dates (day, month, year) or time (hours and
minutes), where multiple fields are expected to be on one line. Read
more about [principles in form design](https://uxplanet.org/the-18-must-do-principles-in-the-form-design-fe89d0127c92).

#### 2 columns layout exceptions apply to:

- ✓ dd – mm – yyyy (date picker)
- ✓ amount – currency
- ✓ national prefix - phone number
- ✓ first name - second name - last name

Information that people will find in the same place

- ✓ CVV and credit card expiry date

Information that are complementary and/or more meaningful if read
together

- ✓ currency - currency exchange rate

When one field is non editable and used for comparison/reference purposes

- ✓ country data input - RB data read only

### Group related fields together into sections or steps

If your form has more than six fields, it’s considered good practice to
group questions into logical sections or steps. Use the `<FormGroup/>`
component for this behaviour.

### Validate Fields after Users Submit the Form

Inline validation post submission minimizes completion times, form
errors, and user frustration. Make sure you’re validating your fields
when users are in revision mode, not completion mode, otherwise you’ll
slow them down.[read more](http://uxmovement.com/forms/why-users-make-more-errors-with-instant-inline-validation/)

### Avoid Multistep (Wizard) forms if not necessary

It is okay to place more than 10 inputs on a page.

### Multistep (Wizard) Forms

Apply to these rules when developing a wizard form:

- Keep the number of steps at the minimum [read more](https://uxplanet.org/wizard-design-pattern-8c86e14f2a38)
- A review step is mandatory. This step should also do a server-side
  check of all data entered and show a summary.
- Show errors when the user wants to change a page (or do live
  validation)
- Stop the user from moving to another page when wrong content was
  entered (make sure it is possible to move to other pages when no
  content is entered, except when it is needed on the following pages)
- Use checkmark indicator once wizard page is filled completely.
- Use warning indicator if some content is filled

### Be clear with your error messages

It doesn’t matter what type of validation you use, you should always use
inline errors. Use them ‘just right here’, in context. But not somewhere
else on the pages. The natural mapping here is your best friend.

<Blockquote title="Example">
  <TextInput
    type="password"
    required
    pattern="(?=.*\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z]).{6,}"
    {...InvalidPasswordProps}
  />
</Blockquote>

And, more importantly, always try to explain the root of the problem.
Try to use a human language and explain what exactly the user/the system
made wrong, and what exactly should be fixed/filled.

### Before submitting content provide dialog modal

Always ask the user before submitting input. Do not ask if the user only
saves the input.
