WFP's visual identity uses a single font family. Like the logo,
WFP blue and the colour pallete, this font is characterizing element of WFP's brand.

### Typefaces

Open Sans is the typeface for user interfaces; it’s a round, humanist
sans-serif, with incredibly warm appeal. It can be used for both headlines and
paragraphs alike, as well as for interface elements.

### How to use it

Open Sans is already included in the WFP UI's CSS. If you don't want to
include the font you can use set **\$css--font-face: false;** inside scss.

### Other languages & styles

The official languages of WFP are English, French, Spanish and Arabic. 
Please use the OpenSans typeface for English, Spanish, and French and the Arial typeface for Arabic.

### DNS Naming

[This guide](https://newgo.wfp.org/documents/dns-conventions/) explains rules for DNS namespace conventions.

## Default formating

See the [Story component](?path=/docs/components-content-related-story--story-text) for applying default styling

## Headings

Headings help to add a hierarchy to a page, and they are key identifiers for
users reading a page. They should be used in an order that is relevant to the
content of a page.
