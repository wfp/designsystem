## When to use a wizard form

Wizards are best employed for long and unfamiliar tasks that the user needs to complete once or rarely. Wizards are shown to reduce errors by making the user follow sequential steps. Wizards are often used for onboarding flows, where the user needs to enter a set of information to get started in an application.

For a fixed sequence of data entry that occurs infrequently.
For untrained users who need to be guided through a stepped process.
For a series of dependable and branched data input flows.
When users need to accomplish a goal that relies on complex task and sub-task completion.
